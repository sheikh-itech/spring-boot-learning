/**
 * Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security concept that
 * allows restricting the resources implemented in web browsers
 * It prevents the JavaScript code producing or consuming the requests
 * against different origin.
 *
 *	For example, your web application is running on 8080 port
 *	And by using JavaScript you are trying to consuming RESTful web services from 9090 port
 *	Under such situations, you will face the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing security issue
 *	on your web browsers
